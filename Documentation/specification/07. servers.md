# API Servers

## The Server Object

E.g.:

```yaml
servers:
- url: https://europe.server.com/v1
  description: Server located in Germany
- url: https://america.server.com/v1
  description: Server located in Atlanta, GA.
- url: https://asia.server.com/v1
  description: Server located in Shenzhen
```

**Which server is taken into account when multiple `server` arrays are specified at different levels for a given operation?**

When multiple `servers` arrays are specified at different levels for a given operation, only the lowest level one is taken into account.

E.g.:

```yaml
servers:
- url: https://server1.com
paths:
  /users:
    get:
      servers:
        - url: https://server2.com
```

GET requests to the `/users` endpoint are served from `https://server2.com` and **not** from `https://server1.com`.

**NOTE:** When providing multiple servers in an OpenAPI document keep in mind that they should all **provide the same API**.

## Server Variables

**How can variables be contained in Server URLs?**

```yaml
servers:
- url: https://{username}.server.com:{port}/{version}
```


**Where should the variables must be detailed?**

These variables **must** then be further detailed in the `variables` field.

**What fields does the [Server Variable Object]() have?**

* `default` (string): This is a **mandatory** field and it is the value that should be used if there is no other value to provide.
* `enum` (array of strings): If present, this array lists the valid values for the variable (and the `default` value must be in the array).
* `description` (string): Documentation always helps understand the purpose of a variable.

E.g.:

```yaml
servers:
- url: https://{username}.server.com:{port}/{version}
  variables:
    username:
      default: demo
      description: This value is assigned by the service provider.
    port:
      enum:
        - "8443"
        - "443"
      default: "8443"
    version:
      default: v1
```
