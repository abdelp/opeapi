# Providing Documentation and Examples

## The Documentation Fields

## Providing Long Descriptions in YAML

* **Literal mode:** (Pipe `|`): Line breaks in the source YAML file are preserved in the output.
* **Folded mode:** (Greater-than `>`): Line breaks are removed so the output is a single string.

## The CommonMark Syntax

## The Example Object

**What does the Example Object allow?**

It allows, among other things:

* **Special rendering** of the examples inside the documentation.
* Example objects can be used by **mock servers** as return values.

**Which fields provide this functionality?**

Two fields provide this functionality: 

* `example`: allows one sample
* `examples`: allows multiple samples

**Only one of the two fields can be present in each object**
